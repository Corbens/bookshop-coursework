# bookshop-coursework
This is my coursework project for my first year module object-oriented programming.

For this project I was assigned with creating a system for a bookshop to help manage their operations. The program was required to support two types of users: admins and customers. Admins needed to be able to view all the books in stock, and be able to add new books into stock. Customers needed to be able to view all the books in stock, search for books and be able to create a basket. This basket would allow them to buy books from the stock.
